        <p>I build intelligent systems that solve complex problems. As a Full Stack Engineer at a PledgX, a Toronto based fintech startup, I use React, Typescript and Python Flask to architect and deploy AI workflows that drive operational efficiency in financial systems.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">I first developed a passion for building at age 12, teaching myself C++ and Direct3D to create a 3D game engine. This early spark led me to earn my BSc in Computer Science from Lakehead University, and I'm currently completing my MSc in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Data Analytics at Boston University to stay at the forefront of emerging technologies.</p>
